# Decentralized Game Contract

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized game smart contract using the [Ink!](https://use.ink/) framework for Substrate. Players can participate in the game by sending funds to the contract. A winner is randomly selected, and 80% of the total prize pool is awarded to the winner, while 20% goes to the admin (burn wallet).

### Features:

- Participants can join the game by sending funds.
- The contract randomly selects a winner at the end of the game.
- 80% of the prize pool is distributed to the winner, and 20% is sent to the admin wallet.
- The game can be restarted by the admin after each round.
